All the meetings were full of good and memorable memories. We learned a lot in this class and had a good time. In one of the sessions, the professor accidentally made my C pipeline and explained it to me after class, It was really enjoyable.
Sometimes I could not answer the professor's questions correctly and this upset me
But he always gave me hope and motivation to try harder, and that made me hopeful and happy.
The Python exam was harder than I thought,But it made me try harder for the next exams.
